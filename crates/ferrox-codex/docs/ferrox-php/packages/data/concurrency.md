# Concurrency Submodule

## 1. Overview (What does this do?)
The `Concurrency` submodule within `ferrox-php-data` encapsulates the localized logic required for enterprise-grade execution of this domain boundary.

## 2. Philosophy (Why does it exist?)
By isolating `Concurrency` into its own distinct submodule, Ferrox enforces the Single Responsibility Principle and guarantees that modifying concurrency logic will not inadvertently corrupt other decoupled systems.

## 3. API & Function Reference
Below is the highly detailed documentation extracted and inferred directly from the codebase for every path, class, and single function within the `Concurrency` submodule:

### Path: `ferrox-php-data/src/Concurrency/Singleflight.php`

#### Class / Interface: `Singleflight`
The `Singleflight` is responsible for enterprise-grade execution of operations within `ferrox-php-data/src/Concurrency/Singleflight.php`.

- **`work(string $key, Closure $callback) : mixed`**
  - @var array&lt;string, mixed&gt; Active requests currently in flight. / private array $flights = []; /** Executes the given closure. If multiple concurrent requests call this method with the same key, only the first one will execute the closure. The others will wait via Swoole Coroutine Channels and receive the same result, dramatically reducing database or API load.
